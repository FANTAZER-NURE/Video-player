I decided to keep videos and events in Context instead of passing them through props into VideoPlayer, in order not to pass redundant props through components multiple times

## Trouble 1
*autoplaing videos*
solved with "muted"

## Trouble 2
*selecting events while playing and scrolling video*
figured out that it can be nice to add videoToTime property to each video, that helped with soluiton
